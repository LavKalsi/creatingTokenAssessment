# Project Title 
 Create a Token 

#  Description
In this program we create a simple token contract called MyToken using the following features:

* Public variables are used to store the token's name, token's abbreviation, and total supply in the token.
* A mapping is created to keep track of balances associated with a perticular addresses.
* A mint function is used to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
* A burn function is used to destroy tokens from a specified address,it also ensues the address has sufficient balance to burn the tokens using the if statement.
# Running the program
To run this program, you can use Remix which is an online Solidity IDE:

* Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
* Copy and paste the code provided above into the new file.
# Compiling the code:
Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" or the version you used specified in the program.
Click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

# Deploy the contract:
Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Select the MyToken contract from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Deploy" button.
Interact with the contract:
Click on the MyToken contract in the left-hand sidebar.
The transact button will be used to perform operations.
Use the mint function to add tokens to an address.
Use the burn function to remove tokens from an address, ensuring the address has sufficient balance.
